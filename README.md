## Feature Complete
These ideas are considered feature complete or complete to the point that I don't plan on returning to them. Ordered by how proud I am of them.

| Project                       | Description
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Last Light](light)           | Game for OMGJam6. Arcade-style puzzle game. Play it [here](https://spencasaurusrex.itch.io/last-light)
| [Hamburgers In Space](burger) | A game made for [OMGJam 4](omg4) where you pilot a hamburger through space, competing against other hamburgers. Obviously pickles are your projectile weapons and your shield is your bun. Naturally. Play it [here](https://spencasaurusrex.itch.io/hamburgers-in-space)
| [Nature's Call](nature)       | Simple platformer for [OMGJam 8](omg8). Play it [here](https://spencasaurusrex.itch.io/natures-call)
| [Digital Oscilliscope][osc]   | A p5.js application that displays sounds just like an oscilliscope would
| [Challenge: Character Customizer][char]| A self-challenge to create a basic character customizer within a certain amount of time
| [Turtle Server](turtle)       | A node.js server meant to allow any number of computers from the mod [ComputerCraft][cc] to update or run scripts simultaneously
| [Stream Screen](stream)       | A simple app that displays "Be Right Back" out of disconnected flowing pixels. Something pretty to look at for Twitch streams
| [SoiBoiBot](soi)              | A Twitch bot to add a bit of personality to chat. A real cutie!
| [Does It Have A Five](five)   | A website that tells the user if the current temperature has a five in it. Could definitely use some polish, but techinically feature complete
| [TaxVisualizer](tax)          | A quick and dirty graph for visualizing the different Tax brackets, and comparing single vs married. Once again, could definitely use polish, but technically feature complete
| [Course Map](courses)         | A visualization of all of the courses at University of Dayton, and how the relate to each other as dependencies. Originally intended to be part of the [Curriculum project][cur]
| [Recipe Calculator][recipe]   | A calculator for the game Factorio that calcalates the total cost of any given recipe in raw resources. Broken since completion due to how the recipe data was stored
| [Blips & Bloops](kj13)        | A game about balancing frequencies for Krass Jam 13. Really needs a tutorial to make sense, but I don't plan on coming back to this

## Abandoned
Ideas that, for one reason or another, I have decided to not pursue further than initial prototypes
| Project                         | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Memoir][mem]                   | The intention was to build a game in the form of a story-telling memoir. I decided to not make this because the content of the memoir could have been more harmful than helpful to some people. Also I believe my original intention was not pure, but attention-seeking.
| [Drawing Sounds][sound]         | Converting a drawn shape into sound by interpreting dx/dy as change in amplitude in either speaker. It doesn't sound pleasant.. |
| [Alchemy Cooking Game][alchemy] | Alchemy-themed cooking game inspired by Overcooked                                                                              |
| [Marching Cubes][cubes]         | Just a quick forray into an ECS-powered marching cubes implementation                                                           |
| [Last Light ECS][ecs]           | A remake of Last Light using ECS                                                                                                |
| [Conduits][conduit]             | A game about managing gates and connections to direct signals in a circuit. Could not get a fun prototype going                 |
| [Math Engine][math]             | A math solver that would be able to perform mathematical manipulations on demand                                                |
| [Harmony][eco]                  | A Minecraft mod inspired by the game Eco. I still would like to make this, but know it's too big of a project for me            |
| [Curriculum][cur]               | A utility application that would allow for better understanding and navigation through a given degree's curriculum              |
| [Stream Game][stream]           | A game that is meant to run as a companion to a Twitch stream. Any users in chat would become a passive player in the game      |
| [Gaia][gaia]                    | A 2D survival sandbox game inspired by others. Still thinking about this due to some inspiration from Graveyard Keeper, but don't plan on continuing this project
| [Stargate: Warfare][sg]         | A strategy game heavily inspired by the Stargate TV Series. This project is too big for me. Parts of this were ressurected as Aetherium
| [Rust Game Engine][rust]        | A game engine powered by Rust... but why?
| [MIPScript][mips]               | A programming language that compiles directly to MIPS
| [Java Game Engine][java]        | A Java game engine powered by LWJGL
| [Souls Text Adventure][dark]    | Dark Souls reimagined as a text adventure. Abandoned due to many reasons
| [Carrot][carrot]                | A custom programming language meant to be used within games at a user level. Intentionally designed to box the player in and not have access to potentially dangerous functionality. Intended to be used as part of [ARA](https://github.com/SpencasaurusRex/ARA)

## Other ideas
A list of other ideas that are just beginning to bud, in order of interest to me

| Project | Description |
| -----   | ----- |
Spectre Console | Duplicate the functionality of https://github.com/spectresystems/spectre.console in Odin
Wire Generator | Generates wires that cross but don't run against one another. Solves using backtracking and random choices. I made this a couple years ago in processing, but I want to port to something else. Would make a neat screen saver
GitHub contribution art | A bot that would automatically make commits to a dedicated GitHub account in order to make art in the contribution graph
Time Tracker | A simple dekstop app (w/ Electron?) that will allow me to set my current activity. My activities will be recorded throughout to keep track of my time
Lazarus | A story and world that I started writing and fleshing out around 2017. Very intriguing to me but I'm not sure where I can go with it
Inf2D | A Unity Asset that would provide the tools necessary to make an infinite procedurally generated top-down 2D world
Hamburgers in Space 2 | Hamburgers in Space, but better
